#What is a Class?
A class in programming is a blueprint for creating objects. It allows you to group common properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that are relevant to a particular object or concept. By defining a class, you can create multiple instances (objects) that share the same structure but may have different values for their attributes.

#For example
let's consider a Car class. All cars share common properties like color, model, and actions like a run button. These are the attributes and behaviors that the Car class would encapsulate. Each car created from the class can have its own unique values (e.g., a red Tesla, a black Toyota), but the fundamental structure (attributes like color, model, etc.) remains the same
